                <h3>The Beginning of Cleanify</h3>
                <p>Cleanify Design was emerged, in a start, from the need to have a framework that mix <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/one-ui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One UI</a> style.</p>
                <p>As I donÂ´t find anything similar to this... I decide to make my own framework.</p>
                <p>The first time, Cleanify was going to be a fork of bootstrap adapted for look as OneUI, but that idea was going to last shortly.</p>

                    <section className="transparent">
                        <p>Then, the idea came out... Why not make my own framework from scratch?</p>
                        <p>And, here we go... An HTML, CSS & JS framework made from scratch based on both styles that I needed.</p>
                        <p>The first version was released and Cleanify Design was saw the light for first time.</p>
