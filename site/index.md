#### HTML5 support

Cleanify use tags implemented in HTML5 for better organization and code reading.

**Examples:** _<nav>_, _<section>_, _<article>_, etc.

{% endsection_transparent %}
{% section_transparent %}
{% highlight html linenos %}
<nav>
    <a class="navbar-title">Cleanify Design</a>
    <ul class="navbar-menu">
        <li>Example Text</li>
    </ul>
</nav>
<article>
    <section>...</section>
</article>
<footer>...</footer>
{% endhighlight %}
{% endsection_transparent %}
{% endarticle_grid %}
{% article_grid %}
{% section_transparent %}

#### Dark Mode

Depending on the theme established in the system (dark or light), Cleanify will adapt to it automatically!

***

Now if Windows is dark, Cleanify too. If Windows is light, Cleanify will be as well.

Also, this was tested in GNOME 3 and also works!
